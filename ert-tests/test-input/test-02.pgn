A top game from last year witnessed a short draw after:} 8. d5 O-O 9. Bd3 Bd6
10. Bg5 Nbd7 11. Nf3 exd5 12. Nxd5 h6 13. Bh4 Qa5+ 14. Qd2 Qxd2+ 15. Kxd2 Ng4
16. Be7 Bxe7 17. Nxe7+ Kh8 18. Rhe1 Nge5 19. Rad1 {1/2-1/2 (19) So,W (2763)
-Karjakin,S (2748) Riga 2019}) 8... Nfd7 9. dxc5 Nxe5 10. Qxd8+ Bxd8 11. Be2 {
All of this has been played recently as well. After some thought Anand
uncorked a novelty.} Bd7 $146 ({The predecessor of one of the main specialists
in the line saw:} 11... Nbd7 12. Be3 Bh4+ 13. Kd2 Be7 14. Ne4 Nf6 15. Nxf6+
Bxf6 16. Nf3 Bd7 17. Kc2 Ng4 18. Bd4 e5 19. h3 exd4 20. hxg4 Bxg4 21. Nxd4 Bxe2
22. Nxe2 O-O-O {where Black obviously did not have any problems at all (to say
at least), Najer,E (2635)-Leko,P (2670) Douglas 2019}) 12. Nf3 {Firouzja is
taking his time as well and reacts in a logical way.} Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3 Bc6 {
The white bishop cannot be tolerated.} 14. Ne4 {Heading to the d6 square.} ({
The obvious:} 14. b4 {was not optimal due to:} Bf6) ({However, it made sense
to secure the d6 spot with:} 14. Bf4 $5 {And only after:} Bxf3 15. gxf3 Nc6 {
To go for:} 16. Ne4) 14... Bc7 $1 {Anand comfortably regroups his forces. But
since the bishop can no longer hurt White on the long diagonal now:} 15. b4 {
Becomes possible.} ({Firouzja correctly avoids:} 15. Nd6+ Bxd6 16. cxd6 Bxf3
17. gxf3 Kd7 {with a pleasant position for Black thanks to the blockade.}) 15...
Nd7 16. Bb2 ({Here though White could have already tried:} 16. Nd6+ Bxd6 {
But not in conjunction with:} 17. cxd6 ({But in connection with the in-between
capture:} 17. Bxc6 $5 Be5 18. Bxb7 Rb8 19. Rb1 Rxb7 20. c6 Rc7 21. cxd7+ Kxd7 {
It is hard to say which is more valuable. White's queenside majority should
technically speaking be more useful, but the black rooks have two nice
half-open files to work on.}) 17... Bxf3 18. gxf3 Ne5 {which is good for Black.
}) 16... Ne5 17. O-O-O {Only this is inaccurate.} ({The king belonged to the
center:} 17. Rd1 {Made more sense, for instance:} Nxf3+ 18. gxf3 f6 19. Rg1 {
with pressure along the half-open files.}) 17... Nxf3 18. gxf3 Bf4+ {An
important difference in comparison to line from above. The bishop will be
active.} 19. Kb1 f6 20. Rhg1 {White's initiative fizzled out. From here on it
will be only Black to improve his position, hence White's next decision to
trade the enemy bishop pair.} Kf7 21. Nd6+ Bxd6 22. Rxd6 g5 {With the threat
of Bc6xf3.} ({Naturally not the immediate:} 22... Bxf3 23. Rd7+) 23. Rf1 ({
There is no tiime for:} 23. b5 Bxf3 24. Rf1 g4) 23... a6 24. Kc2 {Firouzja
does not feel the danger! The OCB endgame is far more insidious than it seems.}
({Better was:} 24. f4 $1 g4 25. Kc2 Rhd8 26. Bd4 {with good chances for
survival.}) 24... Rhd8 25. Kd2 e5 $1 {Now the f3 pawn is fixed and although
will take Black 20 moves to take it, it never stood a chance.} 26. Ke3 Rxd6
27. cxd6 Ke6 28. c5 b6 $1 {Black's pieces are doing great; now he needs the
rook out.} 29. h4 h6 30. hxg5 hxg5 31. cxb6 ({Or:} 31. Rh1 bxc5 32. bxc5 Rb8
33. Bc3 Rb3 34. Kd2 Rb5 {when Black wins a pawn.}) 31... Rb8 32. Rd1 Rxb6 33.
Kf2 {With the idea to maneuver the bishop all the way up to c5.} Ba4 $1 {
Which is easily spoiled by the Indian GM.} ({He could have won a pawn with:} 
33... Bd7 34. Bc1 Rxd6 35. Rxd6+ Kxd6 {However after:} 36. Be3 {It is not easy
to win the pure OCB endgame. White often wants to swap his two pawns for the
opponent's only one and sacrifice his bishop...or even sacrifice the bishop
first in a good moment provided he can get rid of his b-pawn and make it in
time in the corner of the a-pawn.}) 34. Rd2 Rb8 35. Kg3 Rc8 36. Kf2 Rc4 {
The rook is out, but Anand is not in a hurry. He first makes it to the time
control.} 37. Kg3 Rc8 38. Kf2 Rh8 39. Kg3 Rh1 {Then infiltrates with his rook.}
40. Kg2 Rb1 41. Kg3 Bc6 42. Kf2 Kd7 $1 {And sets zugzwang.} 43. Kg3 (43. Kg2 g4
{loses prosaically.}) ({Whereas:} 43. Ke3 Rf1 44. Rf2 Rh1 45. Rd2 Rh3 {dos not
save the f3 pawn neither.}) 43... Rf1 44. Rd3 Ke6 {Anand wants the f3 pawn for
free.} ({Although the connected passers in the line:} 44... e4 45. fxe4 Bxe4
46. Rd2 f5 {are sufficient for the win.}) 45. Kg4 ({Since:} 45. Kg2 Rxf3 $1 46.
Rxf3 g4 {is lost for White.}) 45... Rb1 46. Rd2 Rg1+ {Suddenly it all might
end with checkmate.} 47. Kh3 ({The checkmate is inevitable after:} 47. Kh5 Kf7
48. Rd3 Bd7) 47... Rf1 {There is nothing White can do to save the weak pawn.
Three painful defeats for Firouzja, three hard-lessons-learned for the young
grandmaster.}
